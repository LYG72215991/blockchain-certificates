Technical
- cleanup: update cert variables to cred (much later)
  . and also rename the repository to blockchain-credentials or CRED, etc. (much later)
- add appropriate (lib-specific) exceptions!
- add option to only create the pdfs (in the case of create-certificates) 
- add logging throughout
- PDF plugin for validating from viewer
- ADD SEGWIT tx... for malleability fix (and cheaper txs)

Other
- ADD documentation for issuer identity and verirification methods in issue/create md files
- could we register cred.txt as a .well-known URI through IANA? (requires wide adoption first!)
