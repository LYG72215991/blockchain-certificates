Technical
- cleanup: update cert variables to cred (much later)
  . and also rename the repository to blockchain-credentials or CRED, etc. (much later)
- implement as a library
  . add appropriate (lib-specific) exceptions!
- add option to only create the pdfs (in the case of create-certificates) 
- add logging throughout!
- add testing (unit/system), e.g. with old certificates and past entries
  . certs need to be fake though
- test regtest?
- PDF plugin for validating from viewer
- idea: adding url/qrcode on metadata for extra identification (as a second page to the pdf)!?
  . test if adding/removing pages in the pdf changes the hash!
- ADD SEGWIT tx... for malleability fix (and cheaper txs)
- ADD prerequisite of at least 3 confirmations per issuance and revocation, etc. ?

- ADD documentation for issuer identity and verirification methods in issue/create md files

Functionality
- impl. revoke address
- Decentralized Identity
  . phase 1: link distributed sources of identity (automatic)
    . e.g. via domain name .. expected in /CRED.txt of domain (done)
    . maybe also use sth like: https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list
  . phase 2: proper decentralized identity management (blockchain specific)
    . not really different than domain name and has issues with multiple revoke addresses (investigate)

- when spending UTXOs... always spend all of them (eventually only 2 will exist) and send the change to the same address (test with dust limit as well... to ensure that it is spendable properly)

NOTE
- transactions acquired by the validator (for all services) need to have "change" to the issuer address to be picked up by listreceivedbyaddress
  . for btcd this might not be needed

FUTURE
- could we register cred.txt as a .well-known URI through IANA? (requires wide adoption first!)
