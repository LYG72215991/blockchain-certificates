Technical
- add appropriate (lib-specific) exceptions!
- add option to only create the pdfs (in the case of create-certificates) 
- add logging throughout
- PDF plugin for validating from viewer
- ADD SEGWIT addresses/tx for malleability fix (and cheaper txs)


Other
- could we register cred.txt as a .well-known URI through IANA? (requires wide adoption first!)
