Technical
- cleanup: update cert variables to cred (much later)
  . and also rename the repository to blockchain-credentials (much later)
- implement as a library
  . raise exception instead of stoping execution (done)
  . add appropriate (lib-specific) exceptions!
- fault-tolerance: use 1 of N+ services to acquire OP_RETURN (asap)
- add option to only create the pdfs (in the case of create-certificates) 
- add logging throughout!
- add testing (unit/system), e.g. with old certificates and past entries
  . certs need to be fake though
- support regtest?
- validator to use a local node option?
- PDF plugin for validating from viewer
- idea: adding url/qrcode on metadata for extra identification!?
- ADD SEGWIT tx... for malleability fix (and cheaper txs)
- ADD prerequisite of at least 3 confirmations per issuance and revocation, etc.

Functionality
- impl. revoke address
- Decentralized Identity
  . phase 1: link distributed sources of identity (automatic)
  . phase 2: proper decentralized identity management (blockchain specific)

- when spending UTXOs... always spend all of them (eventually on 2 will exist) and send the change to the same address (test with dust limit as well... to ensure that it is spendable properly)
