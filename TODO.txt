- cleanup: update cert variables to cred
  . and also rename the repository to blockchain-credentials
  . note that metadata for certificates different from metadata for driving licenses!!
    . which affects the validator GUI
    . a global repository of metadata templates might resolve this!
- fault-tolerance: use 1 of N+ services to acquire OP_RETURN
